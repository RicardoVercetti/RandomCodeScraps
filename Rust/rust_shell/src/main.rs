// a shell taked stdin for itself and gives the same to other programs too
// shell also takes stdout form other programs that it runs
// cd is built into the shell's current process
// ctrl + c should send the sigint to the process that the shell is running


// other notes

// things like stdin and stdout have to be already built
// calling commands that are available in the operating system bin should be there
