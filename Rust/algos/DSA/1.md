## Big O complexity

- Big O complexity or time complexity is a way to describe the amount of time and space taken to run a specific algorithmn for a given input size of data
- Since the performance varies based on the hardware of the PC, this is a way to commonly classify the time that a specific program can take


### from the fastest to the slowest

1. O(1) - constant time: algorithmn takes the same time regardless of the input size
2. O(log n) - Lograthimic time: input size shrinks every step
3. O(n) - linear time: time increase as the input size increases
4. O(n log n) - Linearithimic time: some what 1.5x times on each step
5. O(n**2) - Quadratic time: nested loops
6. O(2**n) - Exponential time: work doubles with each extra input
7. O(n!) - Factorial time: worst of all complexities
