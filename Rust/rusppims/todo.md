### PPIMS in Rust

this is just a toy project to rebuild the PPIMS dummy server that I built in python for the DCMS project.
Using this I wanna learn handling http requests, basic serialization and deserialization, file handling, etc in rust.

## Items

- basic get & post server
- define default endpoints
- store customer data in file
- load data on startup
- have ppims headers
- have mobile number for customer dedupe check
- have the KYC restrictions enabled
